## ðŸŽ® How to Play

Before running the game, you need to add the **DanoGameLab** dependency:  
**File â†’ Project Structure â†’ Modules â†’ Dependencies â†’ DanoGameLab.jar**

Once added, run the main class to start the game.  
Use the avatar to explore, jump, and interact with the environment.

## ðŸŒ³ Game Components

### Flora
- **Description:**  
  Manages the generation, addition, and removal of trees within a specified range on the game map.  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Maintains a collection (`mappedTrees`) of `Tree` objects stored by their x-coordinate in a `TreeMap`.  
- **Design Patterns:**  
  - **Strategy Pattern:** Uses `BiConsumer<GameObject, Integer>` to pass strategies for adding/removing objects in the environment.  
    This keeps the logic flexible and encapsulated.

### Tree
- **Description:**  
  Represents a full tree with trunk, leaves, and fruits. Manages creation, addition, and removal of its parts.  
  Implements the `AvatarListener` interface to respond to avatar actions (e.g., jumping).  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Composite object containing `Trunk`, `Leaf`, and `Fruit`.  
  - Listens to avatar events via `AvatarListener`.  
- **Design Patterns:**  
  - **Observer Pattern:** Reacts to avatar jump events.  
  - **Composite Pattern:** A tree is composed of multiple parts (trunk, leaves, fruits), all managed uniformly.

### Trunk
- **Description:**  
  Represents the static, immovable trunk of a tree.  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Managed by the `Tree` class as part of the composite structure.

### Leaf
- **Description:**  
  Represents a tree leaf.  
  Each leaf has an independent scheduled task for animation, enabling natural swaying effects.  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Managed by the `Tree` class.  

### Fruit
- **Description:**  
  Represents fruit that grants energy to the avatar upon collision.  
  After being collected, it respawns after a delay, keeping interactions dynamic.  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Managed by the `Tree` class.  
  - Uses the **Avatar** tag to detect collisions.

## ðŸ§© Design Patterns Summary

- **Strategy Pattern:** Flexible strategies for object management in `Flora`.  
- **Observer Pattern:** Trees listen to avatar events.  
- **Composite Pattern:** Trees are composed of multiple interchangeable parts (`Trunk`, `Leaf`, `Fruit`).
